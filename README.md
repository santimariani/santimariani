WHY, HELLO THERE! 👋🏻

My name is Santi, a full-stack developer with a deep love for beauty and logic, a curious eye for innovation and problem-solving, and an insatiable appetite for continual learning and growth.

Here are some quick Santi Lore facts:

• 🇦🇷 I'm originally from Argentina (so, hablo español). <br>
• 🏠 I live in Spartanburg and LOVE it! <br>
• 🎭 I once performed in a children’s opera and had a BLAST doing it.
• 💵 Finance degree? Check. Nerdy charm? Double check.
• 🍷 I’ve sipped hot wine in Poland and touched Michelangelo's Pieta in Italy (fancy, right?).
• 🍹 I’m a co-creator of the Spartanburg Cocktail Masters (and yes, it’s as cool as it sounds).
• 🐄 Stardew Valley helped me through the 2020 lockdown — farming, but make it pixelated.
• 🥾 When not coding, you’ll find me hiking, avoiding sandy beaches, or watching Minecraft streams.
• 🤓 Did I mention I’m a proud certified geek, nerd, and dork? 'Cause, no cap, I essentially am.
